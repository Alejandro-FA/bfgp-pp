# Elevators

Instances `s1-0`, `s2-0`, `s3-0`, `s4-0` and `s5-0` from `elevators` with conditional effects, negative preconditions and typing (IPC-2000) in [Planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains/#).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
