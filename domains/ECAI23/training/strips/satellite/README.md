# Satellite

Instances `p01-pfile1` to `p05-pfile5` from `satellite` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/satellite).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
