# Blocks

Instances `probBLOCKS-4-0`, `probBLOCKS-5-0`, `probBLOCKS-6-0`, `probBLOCKS-7-0` and `probBLOCKS-8-0` from `blocks` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/blocks).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
