# Driverlog

Instances `p01`, `p02`, `p03`, `p04` and `p05` from `driverlog` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/driverlog).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
