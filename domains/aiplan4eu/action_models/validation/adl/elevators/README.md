# Elevators

Instances `s6-0`, `s7-0`, `s8-0`, `s9-0` and `s10-0` from `elevators` with conditional effects, negative preconditions and typing (IPC-2000) in [Planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains/#).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
