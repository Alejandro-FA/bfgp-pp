# Parking

Instances `p_16_9-04`, `p_18_10-03`, `p_18_10-04`, `p_20_11-03` and `p_20_11-04` from `parking-opt14-strips` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/parking-opt14-strips).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
