# Hanoi

Instances `pfile6`, `pfile7`, `pfile8`, `pfile9` and `pfile10` from `hanoi` (FF Benchmark Set) in [Planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains/#).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
