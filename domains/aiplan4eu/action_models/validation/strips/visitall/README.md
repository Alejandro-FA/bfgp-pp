# Visit All

Instances `p1-10`, `p1-11`, `p1-12`, `p1-13` and `p1-14` from `visitall-opt14-strips` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/visitall-opt14-strips).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
