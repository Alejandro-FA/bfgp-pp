# Gripper

Instance `prob10`, `prob11`, `prob12`, `prob13` and `prob14` from `gripper` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/gripper).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
