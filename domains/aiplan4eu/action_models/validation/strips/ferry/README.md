# Ferry

Instances `p11locs-9cars`, `p12locs-9cars`, `p13locs-9cars`, `p14locs-9cars` and `p15locs-9cars` from `ferry` (FF Benchmark Set) in [Planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains/#).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
