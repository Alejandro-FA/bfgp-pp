# Driverlog

Instances `p10`, `p11`, `p12`, `p13` and `p14` from `driverlog` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/driverlog).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
