# Miconic

Instances `s5-0`, `s6-0`, `s7-0`, `s8-0` and `s9-0`, from `miconic` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/miconic).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
