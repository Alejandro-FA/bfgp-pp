# Grid

Instances `prob01`, `prob02` and `prob03` from `grid` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/grid).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
