# Parking

Instances `p_12_7-01`, `p_12_7-02`, `p_14_8-01`, `p_14_8-02` and `p_16_9-01` from `parking-opt14-strips` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/parking-opt14-strips).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
