Instances `maintenance-1-3-010-010-2-000`, `maintenance-1-3-010-010-2-001` and `maintenance-1-3-010-010-2-002` from `maintenance-opt14-adl` in the [repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks/tree/master/maintenance-opt14-adl).

Plans are generated with the *LAMA* setting of *Fast-Downward* planning system. Then, each deterministic transition with the same action label is grouped into the same folder as a new instance to solve.
