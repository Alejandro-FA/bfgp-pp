    /// This class is responsible for managing the activation of instances in a progressive GeneralizedPlanningProblem
    /// in a multithreaded environment. It allows workers to request the simultaneous activation of an instance in
    /// all threads. All the complexity of managing this activation can be attributed to four requirements:
    ///     1. We need to ensure that active instances are consistent across all threads. Otherwise, the evaluation of
    ///        a node would only be valid in its thread of origin (thus, not allowing to distribute nodes between
    ///        threads).
    ///     2. Activation of instances cannot be done at any moment. We need to ensure that none of the workers are in
    ///        the middle of evaluating, distributing or receiving nodes.
    ///     3. When a thread requests the activation of an instance, multiple threads could request the activation of
    ///        the same instance or different ones before the first activation is handled. We need to ensure that no
    ///        deadlocks occur in this scenario.
    ///     4. Checking if an activation is pending should be a cheap operation, as it will be done frequently. On the
    ///        other hand, activation requests will be sporadic.
